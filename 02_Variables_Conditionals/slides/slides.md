##Git
###What Is Git?

* Git is a source control management tool.
* Git allows you to store and update your code in a structured way.
* Git includes history of changes you make, so you can create "checkpoints" and track your work better over time.
* Git is an intelligent tool, and does many things for you automatically, but can be tricky to use in some cases. It takes a bit of learning to get fully comfortable with Git.

##Git
###What is GitHub?

* GitHub is a service that lets you host Git repositories in the cloud.
	* In other words, they are hosted remotely by GitHub, and can be downloaded from / uploaded to over the internet.
* GitHub allows you to easily distribute code to others by sharing your repository.
* GitHub lets you view your code online easily with a web interface.
* GitHub is free to use as long as you make your code public.
	* Private repositories cost a monthly fee.

###What is a GitHub fork?

* As you work on projects in this class, we want you to use GitHub.
* To gain easy access to all the class files, you will check out the class GitHub repository on your machine.
* In order to ensure that changes you make for your projects do not mix with other students work, you will create a *fork* of the class GitHub repository.
* You will then make changes to your fork, and occasionally pull down changes from the origin class repository.

##Teddit - Strings

Teddit is a news aggregator we will build during this course.

##More Data Types
###Booleans 

* Besides strings and integers, Ruby also has a Boolean data type
* A boolean is a simple value that is either ```true``` or ```false```
* When different data types are compared to each other, the result of that comparison is a boolean result (e.g. 5 < 7 => true)

##Variables & Data Types
###Recap 

Data Types

*	Number
*	Float (number with decimals)
*	String
*	Booleans

Variables

*	Store values
*	Can be passed to methods as parameters

---

##Conditional Logic
###Decision Time 

It's either TRUE or FALSE (like booleans)

If you are greater than 18 
you are an adult

	if age > 18
		puts "You are an adult"
	end

---


##Conditional Logic
###Multiple Conditions


	guess = 7 
	if guess > 5
		puts "Too high!"
	elseif guess < 5
		puts "Too Low!"
	else
		puts "You've guessed my hidden digit!"
	end

## Homework
###Secret Number

Let's see a demo of Secret Number

*	HW 1 - Secret Number
	*	Secret number is a game we will incrementally build for homework during the Ruby portion of the course. 
		Players must guess a secret number and your program will provide feedback.
