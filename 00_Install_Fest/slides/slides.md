### _Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better._ [--Samuel beckett](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Samuel_Beckett)


* Class is a safe place. Take risks. No such thing as a dumb question. 
* Ask questions. 
* Be polite and considerate of everyone else's time. 
* Act like the professional.
* Do the work. You learn by DOING. 
* If you are scared and overwhelmed, just keep coming to class. 
* Do the work. 
* Come to Class.

## How to think like a developer

* Write your code so that someone else can easily understand what it does
* Write code as if you are part of a team, no matter how many people are involved
* Respect the user and product steak holders, honor good coding principles (know when to listen to one over the other)
* Be the developer that everyone wants to work with
* Never be afraid to try
